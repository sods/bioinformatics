**BMS353** is a module where theoretical knowldge is applied to data analysis. In this module we will use tools like programming and statistical methods that enable us to do so. In order to learn smoothly and construct your knowledge in the subject, it is very important that you value and considere the contribution of **feedback** in your learning. To this pourpose there will be a variety of activities during the module that are specifically aimed at:
    
* improving provision of quality feedback
* improving students engagement with feedback. 

Feedback in BMS353 will be given in the following ways:

1. **during lectures and practicals**
2. **with self-marking of notebooks**
3. **in discussion forums**
4. **by email when discussion forums have not answered the question.** 

Please take a look at the university guidance below to help yourself to familiarise with the concept of feedback. 


# The Principles of Feedback (University of Sheffield) - Guidance for students
## Principle 1 Student engagement with feedback is promoted 
Feedback is a 2-way process, an on-going dialogue between you and your lecturers. In order for feedback to work for you, you need to engage with your feedback to improve future performance and the department should help you to do this.


## Principle 2 Feedback is for learning 
Feedback should help you to improve your future performance as well as provide comment on work already done. Feedback should affirm what you already know and offer encouragement. Feedback comes in many forms: written, face-to-face (both individual and collectively), from your peers, electronically via MOLE, in audio files or email. Opportunities for reflection on your feedback should be provided by personal tutors or elsewhere.


## Principle 3 Feedback is clearly communicated to students 
Your department will provide clear information about the types of feedback you will receive and the dates when it is available for all modules.


## Principle 4 Feedback is timely 
You will receive regular feedback throughout your modules, timed to help with your final assessment. Feedback on assessed work will normally be within 3 weeks.


## Principle 5 Feedback is consistently delivered 
Your feedback will be delivered in an accessible and consistent manner, and will relate to module assessment criteria and learning outcomes. There will be an opportunity to view exam scripts.


## Principle 6 Feedback quality is maintained 
Your department will ensure that the feedback you receive is of good quality. Your student reps will be involved in the process of maintaining that quality.
