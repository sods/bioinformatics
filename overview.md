Research Software Instructor: [Dr Mike Croucher](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/)


Semester 1B â€“ Level 3 Biomedical Science 2015/2016

## Description

This module aims to provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts and technologies underlying computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular it will provide biology students with concepts of Bioinformatics and Computational biology for the analysis of biological data. Using a multidisciplinary approach integrated with programming tools, the students will be introduced to statistical concepts underpinning advanced data analysis and methods that are suitable for high-throughput data analysis.

The teaching consists of two hours of lectures and two of lab classes each week.

The lectures are on Thursdays, the labs on Fridays. The teaching schedule and venue for each week are given below.
