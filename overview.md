BMS353 - Bioinformatics for Biomedical Science -- 
Module Co-ordinator: [Dr Marta Milo](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms/research/milo)


Research Software Support: the module is supported by principle of [Open Data Science Initiative]( http://opendsi.cc/) and [Research Software Engineering](http://rse.ac.uk/) in collaboration with [Dr Mike Croucher](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/)


Semester 1B – Level 3 Biomedical Science 2018/2019

## Description

This module aims to provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts and technologies underlying computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular it will provide biology students with concepts of Bioinformatics and Computational biology for the analysis of biological data. 

#### Teaching Methods 
Teaching in BMS353 will be by a multidisciplinary approach, where conventional lectures will be integrated with practical implementation of concepts using programming tools and cloud environment. Lectures will introduce students to statistical concepts underpinning advanced data analysis and methods that are suitable for high-throughput data analysis. Theoretical concepts and detailed examples will be introduced in the lectures and implemented during the practical sessions. This is to provide students with key steps to perform experimental design in data collection, data analysis and results validation.

The course will present state-of-the art research in computational biology with guest lecture and enable students to critically assess statistical methods and enhance innovative thinking in data analysis. Both lectures and practical sessions will be interactive where students questioning and interaction is welcome. A web-based discussion environment will be used as a teaching tool where “Questions and answers” can be led by students and used as a forum for posting comments and suggestions.

#### Study time for this module
BMS353 module is a 10 credit module, where you are expected about 18 contact hours, with each requiring 3 hours of additional study. The module and the practical coursework are designed for the students to complete them within this time range. However, every student has a different learning pace and you can dedicate as much extra time you prefer, should you find the work interesting and want to stretch it further. Dedicated help and support will be provided and being the coding based on an open source platform, the best support is offered by online forums and guided examples. The lecturer will direct and guide you in any additional work.

The teaching consists of two hours of lectures and two of lab classes each week.

Given the complexity of the time table this academic year, please make sure you check on MOLE for the correct location and time of the lectures and practicals. The teaching schedule and venues for each week are given here.
