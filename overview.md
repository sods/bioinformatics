BMS353 - Bioinformatics for Biomedical Science -- 
Module Co-ordinator: [Dr Marta Milo](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms/research/milo)


Research Software Support: [Dr Mike Croucher](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/)


Semester 1A – Level 3 Biomedical Science 2016/2017

## Description

This module aims to provide an understanding of the fundamental concepts and technologies underlying computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular it will provide biology students with concepts of Bioinformatics and Computational biology for the analysis of biological data. Using a multidisciplinary approach integrated with programming tools, the students will be introduced to statistical concepts underpinning advanced data analysis and methods that are suitable for high-throughput data analysis.

The teaching consists of two hours of lectures and two of lab classes each week.

Given the complexity of the time table this academic year, please make sure you check on MOLE for the correct location and time of the lectures and practicals. The teaching schedule and venues for each week are given here.
