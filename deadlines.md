## Lab Classes Deadlines

The practical classes need to be handed in the form of notebooks by the following deadlines:

* Thursday 6th October (Week 2) by 3:00pm
* Thursday 13th October (Week 3) by 3:00pm
* Thursday 20th October (Week 4) by 3:00pm
* Thursday 27th October (Week 5) by 3:00pm
* Thursday 3rd November (Week 6) by 3:00pm

Setup to run the lab classes is using Jupyter notebooks on SageMathCloud.
All the notebooks will have to be uploaded on this system in your labClasses folder including the final project.

Formative feedback will be given on the notebooks that are saved in that folder by the above deadlines. We will use a variety of feedback methods including self assessment and peer marking. The solved notebook for each of the practical sessions will be given on the Friday following the above deadlines.  
Since the final project deadline is far from the end of module it is **recommended** that for your self-assessment task you follow the deadlines below. This will be hugely **helpful** to keep your coding skills fresh for your final project.  


**Suggested Deadlines for Self-assessment**
* **Week 1 assessment**: 7th November (Week 7) by 3:00pm
