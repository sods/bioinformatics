## Exam

The exam for this module will be split in two parts: 

* Part A – A Multiple Choice Question test for the duration of 2hrs, that will count 30% of the grade
* Part B – A notebook with the implementation of allocated projects that will count for 70% of the grade. The project will be a collection of all the tools experienced in the practical labs implemented on a set of real data. It will be developed in groups of three students, but notebook will have to be handed individually. 

The lab practical notebooks handed in during the module will constitute formative feedback that can be used for the final project.
