The exam for this module will be split in two parts: 

* Part A – A Multiple Choice Question test for the duration of 1hr and 30 min, that will count 30% of the final grade
* Part B – A notebook with the implementation of allocated projects that will count for 70% of the final grade. 


The project will be a collection of all the tools experienced in the practical labs, implemented on a set of real data. It will be developed in groups of students, final notebooks will have to be handed in individually. 

The lab practical notebooks handed in during the module will constitute formative feedback that can be used for the final project and to build knowledge and proficiency in coding.
