This module is aimed at biology students with little or no knowledge of programming and statistics, with the aims of

1. making them aware of
effects of experimental design in the subsequent data analysis;

2. having a good understanding of technologies and methods for Bioinformatics and are introduced to basic coding and using of workflow and
pipelines for their data analysis.

It will use a multidisciplinary approach integrated with programming
tools and cloud environment to introduce students statistical concepts
underpinning advanced data analysis and methods that are suitable for
high-throughput data analysis.  Theoretical concepts and detailed
examples will be introduced to provide the students with key steps to
perform experimental design in data collection, data analysis and
results validation.

The course will present state-of-the art research in computational
biology with guest lecture and enable students to critically assess
statistical methods and enhance innovative thinking in data analysis.


#### Prerequisites

The module is dedicated to Level 3 Biomedical Science students but
prerequisites are compulsory. A pre-assessment test can be found
*here*.

#### Recommended text books

There are no specific text books that can cover the material in the
course but a large online resources that can be consulted. These
resources are recommended since they will be the most up-to-date. All
the tools (Jupyter notebook) and the element of R programming upgrade
constantly being open source software.

However, there are a series of text books available in the library for
you to consult:
